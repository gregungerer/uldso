uldso
-----

Uldso is a light weight dynamic linker for loading ELF binaries using the
Linux ELF-FDPIC program loader. The ELF-FDPIC loader is generally used on
non-MMU based Linux systems, although it can be used on some full MMU
Linux systems as well (for example ARM based systems). The standard ELF
loader is not available on non-MMU Linux systems.

The Linux ELF-FDPIC loader can actually load some types of ELF binaries.
Specifically those linked with position independant (PIE) code. Typically
these PIE generated ELF format binaries do still need run-time dynamic
linking. uldso is designed to carry out this run-time linking step.
So typically it is installed as something like /lib/ld.so.1 - in a similar
fashion to what the usual ELF dynamic linker is installed as.

In keeping with simplicty on non-MMU systems in general uldso is designed
to be very simple, and thus also very small.

Uldso does not rely on the ELF-FDPIC register setups, it does traditional
stack searching and auxilary vector parsing to do its link loading.
(Earlier versions of uldso did rely on those register setups, but not all
architectures setup those for the ELF binary case). Generally the relocation
for PIE style binaries is very simple.
